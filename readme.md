## To Do 9/15

- work on Assertion class
- focus on shapes initially 

## To Do 9/13

- parse full parenthetical content of conditionals
  - right now, nested "if" is its own entity as well as being contained in the first one.

- use this method for variables assigned to objects and arrays
  - now have complete object/array and data Type
  - refactor into its own class? Sort of weird with the existence of an actual literal variable class - maybe SketchVar?


## To Do 9/10
- continue defining variables:
  - constant, array, object property
- parse loops
- parse user-created functions
- parse conditionals




## To Do 9/4
- make sketch class
  - add the array of lines to it?
- make a method to define variables?
  - at least with constants
  - can we get initial values of variables that actually vary?
- make separate method for determining type of values
  - and call this for analysis of shape params

### What do I need to handle?
- shapes and analysis
- identifying loops, types of loops, how many times they execute?
- colors and general categorization of them?

### Making an assertion library
- another class, with syntax resembling an actual testing library
- need to standardize language for types of variables, and a way to make this usable and obvious.
